    <h2>Causes of Cyberbullying</h2>
    <p> Anonymity online: When people feel hidden behind a screen, they may act in ways they never would in person. Anonymity can lower empathy and increase cruelty.

Desire for power or control: Some individuals bully to feel superior, assert dominance, or control others—especially if they feel powerless in their offline lives.

Jealousy or revenge: Envy over someone’s looks, popularity, success, or even a past conflict can lead to hurtful actions online.

Peer pressure and group dynamics: In tight-knit online groups or social circles, someone may bully just to fit in or avoid becoming the next target.

Lack of consequences: If people think they can get away with it, they’re more likely to engage in harmful behavior. Weak enforcement of rules can feed into this.

Personal insecurities: Bullying can be a defense mechanism—projecting internal struggles onto others to feel better about oneself.

Entertainment or boredom: Sadly, some engage in cyberbullying simply to amuse themselves or others, especially if they don’t realize the true damage they're causing.










vAdditional Causes of Cyberbullying
Digital disinhibition: The internet can make people feel detached from their actions. This “out of sight, out of mind” effect can lead to behavior they’d never consider in person.

Lack of digital literacy: Some people don’t fully understand the impact of their online actions or how quickly harmful content can spread.

Family environment: Exposure to aggression, neglect, or poor conflict resolution at home can influence someone to act out online.

Mental health struggles: Individuals dealing with anxiety, depression, or trauma may lash out online as a coping mechanism—though it’s never an excuse.

Cultural glorification of drama: Reality TV, viral “call-out” culture, and online clout-chasing can normalize or even reward toxic behavior.

Escapism: Some people use the internet to escape their own problems, and bullying becomes a twisted form of distraction or control.
